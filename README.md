# PZ2_project
Final project for .NET course at AGH UST

The application allows users to review books available in the library.

There are 3 main views:
- the homepage containing personal recommendations described in more detail below
- the "Books" page containing a list of all the books available to review
- the "Reviews" page for a particular book displaying the review interface

Furthermore users can keep a favorites list based on which they will get recommendations on the homepage.

The recommendations are books of user's favorite authors that they don't have on their favorites list yet.
